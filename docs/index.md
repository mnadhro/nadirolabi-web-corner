My name Nadir, I have a PhD in structural engineering, this web site is personal and will host my thoughts, ideas, plans, things I learned and want to share.

I wonder if this could generate math equations in line like $A = \pi r^2$, or 
$$
\varepsilon = E_s \Sigma
$$

let's test it.

+ first list item come here
+ second also
+ and third

her is a numbered list:
1. for one
2. for two
3. for three
4. for four

> could you insert you quot here

I know how to code in pyton;
``` python
import numpy as np
import openseespy as osp
print( osp.version() )

```

thanks,
mno
